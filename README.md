My game is about a young boy called "shan" who suddenlywakes up in an uncharted area of space and is dropped from the planet he used to live on into this barren but intricately designed "museum of cosmic phenomena". Although he is naturally capable of living in a hostileenvironment, he is still eager to get out of this vast andlonely territory.
So he wants to find out where he is, what forces brought him here, what this remote area should have been likewhat the future holds and, above all, how do I get out? Through his preliminary explorations, he will gradually collect the "crystal balls" that carry the "cosmic phenom-ena". He will need all of them to get out of the limited word that I have set up.

The most important purpose of the game istherefore a journey to find the phenomena ofthe universe, and what I have done so far inthe U1 period is to complete a simple con-struction of the universe he has observed.
In my work, the territory depicted is vast.From microscopic atoms to huge stars, from a planetary view of the sun to a cosmic view of galaxies,from collisions of positive and negative matter to supernova explosions, I present it all through programming. This is then inserted into the games I make, where the events are triggered by the characters and then played out. These videos are an animation of the moment before the treasure chest is triggered,and they appear just before the'crystal ball"is obtained. As the animations shown inside the"crystal ball", they representthe rules of the universe, atoms, celestialbodies, energy,light spectrum, etc. The gamecan only be cleared if a certain number of them are collected.
